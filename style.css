/*Step 2. Center the clock on the screen using CSS.
Steps:
In style.css, set body to have a height of 100vh and apply display: flex, justify-content: center, and align-items: center.
Style the clock container (#clock) with a larger font size (e.g., font-size: 3rem) and a simple font family (e.g., Arial, sans-serif).
Check:
Open your browser and confirm that the placeholder text is centered and styled.
*/
/*Exercise 6: Style the Clock for a Polished Look
Goal: Make the clock visually appealing.
Steps:
Experiment with fonts, colors, and spacing in style.css.
Change the background color of the page (e.g., black).
Change the text color of the clock (e.g., white).
Add shadows or gradients for extra effect.
Check:
Confirm that the clock is centered, easy to read, and visually appealing.*/
/*Exercise 7: Make the Clock Responsive
Goal: Ensure the clock looks good on different screen sizes.
Steps:
Add media queries in style.css to adjust the font size for smaller screens (e.g., phones).
Test the design on various screen sizes (you can resize your browser window).
Check:
Verify that the clock resizes appropriately while staying centered.*/
